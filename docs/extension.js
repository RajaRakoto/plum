### ðŸ“Œ Extension

**Plum** simplifies its utilization through a dedicated [VSCode extension](https://github.com/RajaRakoto/plum-extension), encompassing a variety of code snippets. These snippets facilitate swift code generation for invoking mixins, functions, third-party modules, frameworks, ...

**usage**: You can install it by typing "plum" in the extension tab of your IDE

**Prefix**: The extension of **Plum** includes a particular "prefix" to better organize and classify its snippets:

\`\`\`scss
plum-[category]-[name...] (e.g: plum-modules-oc-grape)
\`\`\`

\`[category]\`: These keywords serve as quick references for identifying the appropriate snippets to utilize. Here are the examples of categories (you can see the full list in the extension):

- import
- modules
- specs
- animation
- box
- effect
- input
- image
- position
...

\`[name]\`: This designation denotes a mixin, function, module, or framework name. It acts as a quick identifier for the specific code snippet you wish to employ. For example, if you're opting for the "blue" color scheme, simply typing "plum-blue" will prompt the extension to suggest "plum-modules-oc-blue" for your selection.
